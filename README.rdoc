== What Does It Do?

=== Repository Management

Provides an API for managing a git repository that is suitable for
automation. It is assumed that gestures like creating a new repository,
branch or tag are manual tasks beyond the scope of automation so those are
not covered here. What is provided are APIs for cloning, fetching, listing
and grooming git-related objects.
